Use Surfraw by highlighting your word(s) and pressing a hotkey to type in the Elvis you want to search with

## Usage
- Download the `searchPanel` file and store it somewhere that makes sense for you.
- Download [surfraw](https://gitlab.com/surfraw/Surfraw) or download the updated version that I've included (you'll need to place these files in `/usr/lib/surfraw` or update the location in the script (should be line 3).
- Download [dmenu](https://github.com/stilvoid/dmenu) (fair warning, I don't remember if I downloaded this from here. You may need to play with it if it doesn't work.)
- Pending your OS find out how to assign a hotkey to run a script. [For Ubuntu:](https://techwiser.com/custom-keyboard-shortcuts-ubuntu/)
